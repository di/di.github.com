### Launch ðŸš€

Today, we flipped the proverbial switch, and <https://pypi.org> became _the_
Python Package Index.

Two years ago, when I made my very first contribution to
[`pypa/warehouse`](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/), I never dreamed that it
would one day be my job to work full-time on the project.

However, as luck would have it, that's exactly what I've been doing for the
last five months!

It has been both a blast and an honor to be a part of the team who made this
project a success. These folks are extremely talented, and I'd like to thank
them for all their hard work:

* [Sumana Harihareswara](https://github.com/brainwane/), for running one of the
  most focused and efficient projects I've ever been on, and for always
  thinking about our users;

* [Nicole Harris](https://github.com/nlhkabu/), for turning what would have
  been a pretty janky looking website into something that is clean, beautiful,
  organized, user-tested and accessible;

* [Ernest W. Durbin III](https://github.com/ewdurbin/), for doing a tremendous
  amount of behind-the-scenes infrastructure work, and tracking down nasty
  queries and memory leaks;

* [Donald Stufft](https://github.com/dstufft/), for being a fount of knowledge,
  and for being caremad enough to start a ground-up rewrite of PyPI in the
  first place.

And of course, thanks to Mozilla for [supporting the Python
ecosystem](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/01/23/moss-q4-supporting-python-ecosystem/)
by [providing the funds to make this possible via a MOSS
award](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2017/11/the-psf-awarded-moss-grant-pypi.html).
(If your project is looking for financial support, see

spring, come see my talk ["Inside the Cheeseshop: How Python Packaging
Works"](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/148/), or join me at
