## Education
I finished my Master's degree in Computer Science at [Drexel
University](http://www.drexel.edu/) in Philadelphia, PA in September of 2014,
with a focus in Artificial Intelligence.

I also received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Drexel following
a 5-year program ending in 2006, which included three 6-month internships.
Again, my focus was Artificial Intelligence as well as Human &amp; Computer
Interaction.

## Employment
Since September 2013, I have been self-employed as a remote developer and as the co-owner of [Wiota Co.](http://wiota.co), a design &amp; build firm with a focus on creating high-quality online portfolios for professional artists. I work in a fully-remote, small-team setting to build an MVC-based back-end applications. I'm responsible for database schema design, RESTful API design, and information management. I also support development of front-end applications, including debugging, testing, and UI/UX decisions.

From March 2011 to June 2012 (and again from January 2013 to September 2013) I worked as a software engineer at the [Applied Informatics Group](http://drexel.edu/cci/research/centers/AIG/) in Philadelphia, PA, primarily working with distributed systems, network emulation, information protocols and autonomous agent simulation. I helped build a serverless, cross-platform, asynchronous group messaging framework, and was invited to and presented work on tactical chat at the 2011 Joint Chat Systems Conference.

In early 2012, I was selected by the [American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)](http://www.asee.org/) to participate in the [Naval Research Intern Program](http://nreip.asee.org/) as a software developer at the [Space &amp; Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR)](http://www.spawar.navy.mil/) in San Diego, CA. From July to December of that year, I joined an Agile development team and built analytical tools, search algorithms and RESTful web applications for information analysts.

In late 2010 I was selected to participate in an [international research exchange program](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0930785) funded by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](http://www.nsf.gov/). I worked as a visiting scientist at the [Czech Technical University](https://www.cvut.cz/) in Prague, Czech Republic from January 2011 – March 2011. While there, I spent most time developing [AHOY](https://github.com/di/ahoy), an event-based simulation environment designed to test networked multi-agent systems.

From April - September 2010, I worked as a software engineer at the [Networks and Communication Systems Branch](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/) of the [U.S. Naval Research Laboratory](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/) in Washington, DC, using large-scale, distributed, heterogeneous network emulation and modeling systems to collect research data. Here, I contributed to an [open-source mobile network emulator](http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core), adding features for pathloss and propagation prediction.

From April 2008 - March 2010, I was a software engineer at the [Applied Communication &amp; Information Networking Center](http://www.acincenter.org/) in Camden, NJ, where I contributed to papers and projects involving mobile ad-hoc networks, mobile agents, and multicast traffic.
